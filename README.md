## Overview

crules (Cursor Rules) is a command-line tool that helps you manage AI agent rules across multiple projects. It provides commands for initializing, syncing, and merging rule files, as well as an interactive agent selection system.

**Features Overview**: Command-line tool for managing AI agent rules across projects

## üåü Features

- **Rule Synchronization**: Keep rules in sync across multiple projects
- **Agent System**: Work with specialized AI agents for different tasks
- **Interactive Selection**: Choose agents through an intuitive terminal UI
- **Project Management**: Register and track projects with rule directories

**Try it out!** The tool provides an intuitive interface for working with AI agent rules.

## üì¶ Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap nsnarender5511/tap

# Install crules
brew install crules
```

**Note**: Follow these commands to install via Homebrew.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/nsnarender5511/crules/releases).
2. Extract the archive (if applicable).
3. Move the `crules` binary to a location in your PATH.

**Note**: These steps will install crules manually on your system.

## Homebrew Tap Setup (for maintainers)

To set up the Homebrew tap repository:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-tap` under your GitHub account.
2. Initialize it with a README.md file.
3. Once the repository is created, you can release crules using GoReleaser:

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Run GoReleaser (requires a GITHUB_TOKEN)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
goreleaser release --clean
```

This will automatically build the binaries, create the release on GitHub, and update the Homebrew tap.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize rules in the current directory
crules init

# List available agents
crules agent list

# Select an agent interactively
crules agent select

# Get detailed information about a specific agent
crules agent info wizard

# Synchronize rules from the main location
crules sync

# Merge rules from the current directory to the main location
crules merge

# List all registered projects
crules list
```

**Quick Start Guide**: These commands will help you get started with crules quickly.

## ü§ñ Agent System

The Agent System allows you to work with specialized AI agents for different tasks in software development:

| Agent | Description |

| **Technical Wizard** | Provides high-level technical guidance and coordinates other agents |
| **Feature Planner** | Breaks down requirements into implementation tasks |
| **Fix Planner** | Analyzes issues and develops fix strategies |
| **Implementer** | Translates plans into code |
| **Runner** | Executes and tests code |
| **Documentation** | Creates and maintains documentation |
| **Code Reviewer** | Performs thorough code reviews |
| **Git Committer** | Creates conventional format commit messages |

**Note**: Use the agent selection interface to choose the right agent for your task.
