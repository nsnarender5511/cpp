## Overview

crules (Cursor Rules) is a command-line tool that helps you manage AI agent rules across multiple projects. It provides commands for initializing, syncing, and merging rule files, as well as an interactive agent selection system.

## Features

- **Rule Synchronization**: Keep rules in sync across multiple projects
- **Agent System**: Work with specialized AI agents for different tasks
- **Interactive Selection**: Choose agents through an intuitive terminal UI
- **Project Management**: Register and track projects with rule directories

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

Once the Homebrew tap is available, you can install crules with:

```bash
# Add the tap
brew tap nsnarender5511/tap

# Install crules
brew install crules
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/nsnarender5511/crules/releases).
2. Extract the archive (if applicable).
3. Move the `crules` binary to a location in your PATH.

## Homebrew Tap Setup (for maintainers)

To set up the Homebrew tap repository:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-tap` under your GitHub account.
2. Initialize it with a README.md file.
3. Once the repository is created, you can release crules using GoReleaser:

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Run GoReleaser (requires a GITHUB_TOKEN)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
goreleaser release --clean
```

This will automatically build the binaries, create the release on GitHub, and update the Homebrew tap.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize rules in the current directory
crules init

# List available agents
crules agent list

# Select an agent interactively
crules agent select

# Get detailed information about a specific agent
crules agent info wizard

# Synchronize rules from the main location
crules sync

# Merge rules from the current directory to the main location
crules merge

# List all registered projects
crules list
```

## Agent System

The Agent System allows you to work with specialized AI agents for different tasks in software development:

- **Technical Wizard**: Provides high-level technical guidance
- **Feature Planner**: Breaks down requirements into implementation tasks
- **Fix Planner**: Analyzes issues and develops fix strategies
- **Implementer**: Translates plans into code
- **Runner**: Executes and tests code
- **Documentation**: Creates and maintains documentation

Learn more about the Agent System in the [documentation](./docs/user-guide/agents.md).

## Commands

crules provides several commands to manage your rules:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `init` | Initializes the current directory with rules from the main location |
| `merge` | Merges current rules to the main location and syncs them to all locations |
| `sync` | Forces synchronization from the main location to the current directory |
| `list` | Displays all registered projects |
| `clean` | Removes non-existent projects from the registry |
| `agent list` | Lists all available agents |
| `agent info <id>` | Shows detailed information about a specific agent |
| `agent select` | Interactively selects and loads an agent |

For detailed information about commands, see the [Command Reference](./docs/user-guide/commands.md).

## Configuration

crules stores its configuration in `~/.config/crules/config.json`. This file contains:

- The main rules location
- Registered project locations

## Developer Guide

### Release Process

There are two ways to create a new release:

#### 1. Local Release (using GoReleaser locally)

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with your GitHub token:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```

2. Run the release make target with your desired version:
   ```bash
   make release TAG=v0.0.1
   ```

#### 2. GitHub Actions Release (recommended)

This method leverages GitHub Actions to handle the release process:

1. Ensure all your changes are committed and pushed
2. Run:
   ```bash
   make release-github TAG=v0.0.1
   ```

This will:
- Verify your working directory is clean
- Create and push a git tag
- Automatically trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
- Build and publish the release using GitHub's infrastructure

The GitHub Actions workflow will:
- Build binaries for all supported platforms
- Create a GitHub release
- Update the Homebrew formula
- Update the Scoop manifest

You can monitor the progress at GitHub Actions tab in your repository.
